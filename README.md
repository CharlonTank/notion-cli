## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharlonTank/notion-cli-rs.git
cd notion-cli-rs
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Configuration

1. Create a Notion integration:
   - Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Click "New integration"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Task Manager CLI")
   - Copy the "Internal Integration Token"

2. Create a Notion database with the following properties:
   - "Name" column (title type)
   - "Status" column (status type with options: "Not started", "In progress", "Done")
   - "Priority" column (select type with options: "High", "Medium", "Low")
   - "Due Date" column (date type)
   - "Tags" column (multi-select type)
   - "Description" column (text type)

3. Share the database with your integration:
   - Open your database in Notion
   - Click "..." in the top right
   - Click "Add connections"
   - Select your integration

4. Copy the database ID from the URL:
   - Open your database in Notion
   - The URL will look like: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/DATABASE_ID?v=...`
   - Copy the DATABASE_ID part

5. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then add your credentials:
```
NOTION_TOKEN=your_integration_token
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
LOCAL_TIMEZONE='Your/Timezone'
```

## Usage

# Add a new task (basic)
